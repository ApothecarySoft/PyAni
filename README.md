# PyAni
Generates a list of recommendations based on a public AniList profile.  
Currently uses Anilist's crowdsourced recommendations as the core source, also taking into account the user's own ratings and common tags.
# Prerequisites
    pip install "gql[all]"
if you don't have it already
# Usage
run nextani.py in python3 along with the username of a public Anilist profile  
supports optional flags
- -r to force refresh from the server
- -h to display help
# AniList is mean
they rate limit their API pretty strictly so fetching data from the server can take 5-10 minutes  
data is cached locally after that, though, so subsequent runs are quicker unless you force refresh
